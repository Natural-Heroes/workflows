# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-25)

**Core value:** LLM can answer questions about stock history (stockouts, duration, value) by querying Inventory Planner data
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation Validation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Foundation Validation)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-25 - Completed 01-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 5 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1/2 | 5 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min)
- Trend: First plan complete

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Codebase is ~85% complete; focus on validation and gap-closing rather than greenfield implementation
- [Roadmap]: Historical analytics (HIST-*) deferred to v2 pending API verification
- [01-01]: App/server separation - Extract Express app to app.ts for supertest compatibility
- [01-01]: Co-located tests - Place test files next to source files (*.test.ts pattern)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research identified potential gap: Historical stockout data may not be available via API (affects v2 scope, not v1)
- Rate limit values are conservative estimates (30 tokens, 3/sec); may need tuning after production validation
