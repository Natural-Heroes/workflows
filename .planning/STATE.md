## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Codebase is ~85% complete; focus on validation and gap-closing rather than greenfield implementation
- [Roadmap]: Historical analytics (HIST-*) deferred to v2 pending API verification

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research identified potential gap: Historical stockout data may not be available via API (affects v2 scope, not v1)
- Rate limit values are conservative estimates (30 tokens, 3/sec); may need tuning after production validation
